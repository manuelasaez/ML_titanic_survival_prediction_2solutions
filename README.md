# Titanic Survival Prediction
## Motivation
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, resulting in the loss of over 1,500 lives. Understanding the factors that influenced the survival of passengers can provide valuable insights into human behavior and decision-making in life-and-death situations. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to predict the likelihood of survival for individuals based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the survival probability of a Titanic passenger based on available data. This project not only serves as an interesting historical analysis but also as a practical exercise in applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

## Technical Details
Our Titanic survival prediction project is built using Python and incorporates several powerful libraries and tools to achieve high accuracy and performance. Below are the key technical components and libraries used in this project:

## Libraries and Tools:
* pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library, used for loading and preprocessing the Titanic dataset.
* numpy: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, used for various numerical operations.
* scikit-learn: A robust library for machine learning in Python, used for building and evaluating predictive models.
* matplotlib: A plotting library for Python, used for data visualization.
* seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib, used for creating informative and attractive visualizations.
* Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
## Workflow:
* Data Collection: The Titanic dataset is obtained from Kaggle's Titanic competition, which includes information about passengers such as age, sex, class, fare, and more.
* Data Preprocessing: Use pandas and numpy for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to create meaningful input features for the model.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data and understand the relationships between different features and survival rates.
* Feature Selection: Identify the most significant features that contribute to the prediction of survival.
* Model Training: Implement and train various machine learning models using scikit-learn, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best-performing model.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the selected model's hyperparameters to improve its predictive accuracy.
* Visualization of Results: Create visualizations to interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of different features on survival.
